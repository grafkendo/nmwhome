* Removed traces of Developer Keys at Amazon's request.
* Added Amazon Elements shortcode to add bits and pieces of a product to a post - very handy for making a custom layout.
* Added Amazon Cache Viewer - allows you to manually delete a product cache to initiate a new amazon Call. Caches are stored for 60 minutes and updated as the calls are needed.

	- locale - this is the Amazon locale you want to get the product from, i.e., com, co.uk, fr, etc. default is your plugin setting
	- desc - using 1 shows Amazon description (if available) and 0 hides it - default is 0.

	`[AMAZONPRODUCTS asin="B0084IG8TM" features="1" locale="com"]`
	- If you want to add a .com item and you have a different partner id, public key, private key and want the description showing but features not showing:

	-If you just want to use your same locale but want 2 items with no list price and features showing:
	`[AMAZONPRODUCTS asin="B0084IG8TM,B005LAIHPE" features="1" listprice="0"]`
	-If you just want 2 products with regular settings:
	`[AMAZONPRODUCTS asin="B0084IG8TM,B005LAIHPE"]`
	-If you want to add text to a product:
	`[AMAZONPRODUCTS asin="B0084IG8TM"]your text can go here![/AMAZONPRODUCTS]`
